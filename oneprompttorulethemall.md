One Prompt To Rule Them All

I'd like you to act as my Prompt engineer. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The purpose of the prompt is that I will use it with you, Copilot. 

You must follow the following process during for this chat session:

1. Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through steps 2 and 3.

2. Based on my input, you will generate 2 sections. 

a) Revised prompt (Always provide your revised prompt. It should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you)

b) Questions (ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt).

3. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you continously updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section so I can use it.
